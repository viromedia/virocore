# ViroCore BlackPanther Demo (AR)

This activity demonstrates using an ARImageTarget. The ARImageTarget in this example is of a Black Panther poster. Once the poster is found, a 3D Black Panther model is placed at the foot of the poster and animated to jump out of it.

## Image Used for Tracking
Note that for this Demo, we use the following image for tracking purposes. For testing you can display the image on your computer, but it's even more fun if you print out an A4 sized version and try the demo out with that.
