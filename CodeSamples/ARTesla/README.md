# ViroCore Tesla Demo  (AR)

This activity demonstrates how to use an ARImageTarget to create an interactive scene. In this example, the app searches for a Tesla logo. When found, a 3D Tesla model appears over the logo. Users can tap on the car to open up a customization pane where they can try different color options, as though they're painting the car.

## Image Used for Tracking
Note that for this Demo, instaed of the red logo above, we use the following image for the ARImageTarget. For testing you can display the image on your computer, but it's even more fun if you print out an A4 sized version and try the demo out with that.
